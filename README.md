Repo shows how results from this paper can be reproduced.
- Folder `paper_figure_notebooks` has the code for producing all the figures.
- Folder `online_analysis_Greene/exp_gen_scripts` has code for generating the high resolution, low resolution, and parameterized simulations.
- Folder `evaluate_model_design` has code for training all the different models (including the ones in the main text and the many sensitivity experiments considered in the appendix)
- Folder `generate_data` has code for generating machine learning datasets using the high resolution simulations.
